        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from
          the University of Santo Tomas. But instead of pursuing a traditional
          path in engineering, I made the bold decision to shift careers and
          dive into the world of web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve built multiple personal projects, taught
          myself new technologies, and slowly transitioned into the software
          industry. But if thereâ€™s one regret I haveâ€”itâ€™s that I never took the
          time to document my progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the lessons, challenges, and breakthroughs I experienced were kept
          to myself. Some of it was due to a lack of Git skills early on, and
          honestly, creating a blog platform back then felt way out of reach.

        <h2>Why Iâ€™m Starting Now</h2>
        <h3>1. To Reinforce What I Learn</h3>
        <p>
          Writing helps solidify my understanding. Whether itâ€™s a new framework,
          a design pattern, or even a small JavaScript trickâ€”writing about it
          forces me to slow down, reflect, and truly grasp the concept. Itâ€™s my
          way of thinking out loud, but in a way that might help someone else
          too.
        </p>
        <h3>2. To Create a Timeline of Growth</h3>
        <p>
          Itâ€™s easy to forget how far youâ€™ve come when youâ€™re always focused on
          whatâ€™s next. This blog will act as a personal archiveâ€”a way to look
          back at where I started, how I solved problems, and what technologies
          I was curious about at different points in my journey.

        <h2>What Youâ€™ll Find Here</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ll be sharing what Iâ€™m currently learning and buildingâ€”topics like
          React, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and my thoughts on full-stack
          development in general. Some posts may be quick reflections, others
          more in-depth walkthroughs or how-tos. Either way, this space will
          grow alongside my skills.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Whether youâ€™re a fellow career shifter, a self-taught developer, or
          just curious about the processâ€”thanks for stopping by. Iâ€™m excited
          (and a little nervous) to start writing in public, but I know itâ€™s the
          next step I need.
        </p>
        <p>Letâ€™s keep learning and building. ðŸš€</p>
